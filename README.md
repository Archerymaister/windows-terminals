# Windows Terminals

This repository is ment to agregate some of the best Windows Terminals themes there are around there, with all the definitions and color schemas. Feel free to create a new pull request with your favourite theme.

## Inspiration:

This amazing [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/gnqw1y/can_we_show_off_our_new_terminals/) gave me the inspitation to compile these beautiful themes.

## Resources

## Notes

If you ever find reference to `ms-appdata:///roaming` for Windows Terminal, that's transalated into:

```shell
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\RoamingState
```

You can try this out by hit Win+R following the path above. This will be the local user roaming data for Windows Terminal.

I'll try to agregate the fonts as much as possible in the [fonts](fonts/) folder.
